# Terms of Service

## Introduction
Welcome to BlueFish! BlueFish is a Web3 community and asset management platform that allows users to manage their crypto assets, swap tokens, engage in Web3 communities, and participate in mission-based airdrops.

By accessing or using the BlueFish application, website, or services ("Services"), you agree to these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree with these Terms, do not use BlueFish.

If you have any questions, please contact us at cs@blockify.it.

## 1. Eligibility
To use BlueFish, you must:

Be at least 18 years old (or the legal age in your jurisdiction).

Not be located in sanctioned countries or regions restricted by international laws.

Not be barred from using Web3 services under applicable regulations.

## 2. Non-Custodial & User Responsibility
### You Own Your Assets & Private Keys 
BlueFish is a non-custodial wallet and platform. This means:

We do not store or control your private keys.

You are fully responsible for your assets and transactions.

Lost private keys cannot be recovered by BlueFish.

### No Liability for Losses 
Since BlueFish does not hold user funds, we are not responsible for any asset loss, theft, or transaction errors.

## 3. Account & Security
**Account Registration:** Some features may require a verified account (e.g., for advanced Web3 integrations).

**Security Measures:** You are responsible for securing your login credentials, wallet seed phrases, and private keys.

**Unauthorized Access:** If you suspect unauthorized activity, you must notify us immediately.

**Important:** BlueFish will never ask for your private key or seed phrase. Be cautious of phishing attempts!

## 4. Permitted & Prohibited Uses
### 4.1 Permitted Uses:
Using BlueFish for personal and legal Web3 activities.

Engaging in token swaps, airdrops, and decentralized social interactions.

Participating in community-driven initiatives.

### 4.2 Prohibited Uses:

Using BlueFish for money laundering or financial crimes.

Attempting to reverse-engineer, tamper, or exploit BlueFish systems.

Impersonating other users or violating privacy policies.

Violation of these rules may result in immediate account termination.

## 5. Token Swaps & Airdrops
**Swaps:** BlueFish aggregates decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to provide the best rates. Transactions are final and non-reversible.

**Airdrops:** Users may participate in mission-based airdrops, but rewards are not guaranteed.

**Smart Contract Risks:** Users acknowledge the risks involved with smart contract interactions, including price slippage, liquidity shortages, and transaction failures. BlueFish is not responsible for losses due to smart contract vulnerabilities.

**Service Outages & Network Failures:** BlueFish does not guarantee uninterrupted service, and we are not responsible for network congestion, blockchain forks, or external service failures that may affect transactions.

## 6. Fees & Payments
BlueFish does not charge hidden fees.

Gas fees apply for blockchain transactions and are determined by network conditions.

Third-party services may have separate fees.

## 7. Third-Party Services & DApps
BlueFish integrates with third-party services and DApps. When using them:

You are bound by their terms & policies.

BlueFish is not responsible for third-party failures, losses, or security breaches.

Users are responsible for reviewing and accepting the privacy policies and terms of any third-party services they interact with.

BlueFish does not endorse or guarantee the security of any third-party services.

Users acknowledge that third-party services may carry risks, including data loss, security vulnerabilities, and smart contract failures. BlueFish holds no liability for damages resulting from third-party service interactions.

## 8. Privacy & Data Protection
BlueFish values privacy and follows global data protection laws (GDPR, CCPA, PIPL, etc.).

We do not store private keys.

We do not sell user data.

Users can manage data settings in-app.

See our BlueFish Privacy Policy for full details.

## 9. KYC/AML Compliance
BlueFish currently does not require KYC (Know Your Customer) verification, but certain services may require identity verification in the future due to legal or regulatory changes.

Users agree to comply with applicable laws, and BlueFish may implement KYC/AML requirements if necessary.

If KYC is introduced, personal data will only be used for compliance purposes and will not be shared with third parties beyond legal obligations.

Users have the right to refuse KYC verification; however, certain services may become unavailable if verification is declined.

If a regulatory change results in access restrictions for certain jurisdictions, BlueFish reserves the right to suspend or restrict access to affected users.

## 10. Service Modifications & Termination
BlueFish may modify, discontinue, or terminate services at any time. In case of service termination, we will provide at least 30 days' notice to users via email, app notifications, or website announcements.

Users are responsible for backing up their wallet information and transaction data before service termination. BlueFish is not liable for data loss after service discontinuation.

Upon termination, users will be provided with an option to download their transaction data and, where applicable, request data migration to another service.

## 11. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution
These Terms are governed by the laws of Vietnam.

All disputes shall be resolved through binding arbitration under the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC).

Users waive the right to class action lawsuits or jury trials.

BlueFish is not liable for legal disputes arising from regulatory changes in a user's jurisdiction.

If regulatory changes impose new restrictions on Web3 services, BlueFish may modify its services accordingly without liability to affected users.
